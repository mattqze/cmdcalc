# cmdcalc
Updated version of [CLI-Calc](https://github.com/mattqze/clicalc)<br>
Instead of using "calc add 200 300" now it is as simple as typing "calc 200 + 300" with this brand new version.<br>
No more history.calc and fullhistory.calc, now if you run into an error it prints directly to you.<br>
Comments describing what I am doing are also present in this version.
